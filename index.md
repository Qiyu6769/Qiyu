_**[10-Ks analysis](/mid_report/report.md)**_


By clicking on the 10-Ks analysis, a detailed report can be accessed. The primary objective of this analysis is to establish the correlation between various variables and returns. In terms of innovation, two noteworthy outcomes(negative/positive) have been identified and are listed below:

Negative:

Positive:

_**[Regression Practice](/regression/regression.md)**_

This document focuses on the interpretation of linear regression coefficients in house price forecasting and aims to identify the variable with the strongest relative correlation. It should be noted that the original data contains outliers and missing values, which have not been addressed in this analysis. Please click the Regression Practice to see the whole analysis.

_**[Housing price prediction 1](/prediction_model/model.md)**_

For raw data processing, first of all, I removed the values with a missing value greater than 80%, and selected a few variables that I thought were more informative to make a graph to see if they had outlier, and removed them. I selected lasso, lassoCV, RandomForestRegressor, LGBMRegressor, and XGBRegressor for the prediction models. I compared the respective R2 and selected the highest value for the holdout prediction. (To avoid overfitting the model as much as possible)

**LGBMRegressor** is the one I chose at last. The R2 score is 0.9960.

these are the top 10 predictor variables for the model:

_**[Team project](/prediction_model/model.md)**_   *## We will address how to get the public website on Monday* 

We have developed a comprehensive dashboard that provides insightful visualizations of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the supply chain industry. Our dashboard encompasses a variety of supply chain companies that have been merged with the S&P 500, providing users with a broad perspective on the market trends. The dashboard enables users to evaluate the level of participation for each seller industry and provides access to the accounting messages of individual seller companies. 

Our team has leveraged advanced analytics and data visualization techniques to develop an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard that enables users to navigate and interpret the data with ease. The dashboard provides real-time updates and is a valuable resource for investors and analysts seeking to monitor the supply chain industry's impact during these challenging times.

_**[Housing price prediction 2](/other_regression/Final_hand.md)**_

The primary objective of this analysis is to forecast housing prices. To achieve this, various regression models, including Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gboost, were compared. Based on the evaluation of the mean squared error (MSE), the linear regression model was selected as the optimal predictor. The predicted results are presented below:
